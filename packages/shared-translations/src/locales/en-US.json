        "whatIsThis": {
          "question": "How does this solve the indoor court problem?",
          "answer": "We're helping Canadian tennis and pickleball players deal with the indoor court shortage during winter months. We're building tools to help players find partners who have already booked courts, share costs, and fill last-minute cancellations—maximizing the use of existing facilities."
        },

          "question": "What do Founding Members get?",
          "answer": "Founding Members get premium features completely free when we launch. You'll also help shape the product through our survey, get priority access to the app, and be part of the community from day one."
        },
        "whenLaunch": {
          "question": "When will this be available?",
          "answer": "We're launching in early 2026, just in time for the outdoor season. You'll have the full summer to build your network and master the app, so when winter 2026-2027 arrives, you'll be ready to dominate indoor court bookings. Join the waitlist to be notified when we launch."
        },
        "bothSports": {
          "question": "Does this work for both tennis and pickleball?",
          "answer": "Yes! The indoor court shortage affects both tennis and pickleball players. Our platform is designed to help players of both sports find partners, share costs, and maximize court time."
        },
        "howHelp": {
          "question": "How will this help with the court shortage?",
          "answer": "While we can't build new courts overnight, we can help maximize the use of existing facilities. By connecting players who need courts with those who have them booked, sharing costs, and filling cancellations, we ensure every minute of court time is used."
