## Visibility in Directory

### What Others See

| Player Has           | Others See                      |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Profile Public = Yes | Full profile card in directory  |
| Profile Public = No  | Not visible in directory search |
| Calendar = Public    | Calendar on profile             |
| Calendar = Private   | "Calendar not available"        |

### Hidden from Directory

Players can hide from directory entirely:

- Still have account
- Can create/accept matches
- Won't appear in search results
- Can be invited if someone has their contact

## Blocking

When a player blocks another:

| Blocked Player Sees             | Blocker Sees                         |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Nothing changes in their view   | Blocked player hidden from all views |
| Cannot see blocker in directory | Cannot receive invites from blocked  |
| Cannot send invites             | Cannot receive messages              |

See [Player Relations](../07-player-relations/README.md) for blocking details.

## Recommendations

### For New Players

- Encourage public profiles for better discoverability
- Explain benefits of being visible
- Easy toggle to adjust later

### Privacy-First Approach

- Default to minimal visibility
- Let players opt-in to more visibility
- Clear explanations of each setting
