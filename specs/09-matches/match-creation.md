# Match Creation

## UX Priority

> **Critical:** Match creation must be completed VERY QUICKLY (seconds ideally). Speed impacts user retention significantly.

**Strategies:**

- Pre-fill from user preferences
- Smart defaults
- Minimal required fields
- Draft persistence (auto-save progress)
- One-tap templates (future)

## Wizard Structure

Match creation uses a **3-step wizard** with horizontal slide animations, progress indicator, and swipe gestures:

1. **Step 1: Where** - Location selection
2. **Step 2: When** - Date, time, duration, timezone
3. **Step 3: Preferences** - Format, expectations, court status, cost, visibility, join mode, opponent preferences, notes

## Step 1: Where

### Location Type

| Type         | Description                        | Required Fields |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------- | --------------- |
| **Facility** | Select from registered facilities  | `facilityId`    |
| **Custom**   | Enter custom location name/address | `locationName`  |
| **TBD**      | Location to be determined later    | None            |

### Facility Selection

- Search facilities by name
- Shows distance from user's location
- Displays preferred facility badge (if user has one set)
- Shows available court slots (if facility has booking integration)
- User can book a slot directly, which auto-fills date/time/duration in Step 2

### Custom Location

- Google Places autocomplete search
- Manual address entry/edit
- Optional coordinates (auto-fetched from place details)

### Field Details

| Field            | Required    | Default/Pre-fill                                    |

### Locked Fields
