# Blocking

## Overview

Players can block others to prevent unwanted contact and interactions.

## Blocking a Player

### How to Block

From player profile or conversation:

1. Tap menu (⋮)
2. Select "Block Player"
3. Confirm action
4. Player blocked immediately

### What Happens

| For the Blocker                      | For the Blocked                     |
| ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| Blocked player hidden from all views | No notification of being blocked    |
| Cannot receive invites from blocked  | Cannot send invites to blocker      |
| Cannot receive messages from blocked | Cannot send messages to blocker     |
| Blocked list in settings             | Appears as if blocker doesn't exist |

## Effects of Blocking

### In Player Directory

- Blocked players don't appear in search results
- Blocker doesn't appear in blocked player's search

### In Groups/Communities

- If both are in same group/community:
  - They don't see each other's messages
  - Match invitations sent by one don't reach the other
  - Consider: Should they see each other in member list?

### In Matches

- Cannot be matched together
- If a match invitation is sent to a group containing blocked player:
  - Blocked player doesn't receive it
  - Others in group still receive it

### Unblocking

1. Go to Blocked Players list
2. Tap "Unblock" next to player
3. Confirm
4. Player unblocked

After unblocking:

- Player visible again in directory
- Can receive invites/messages again
- Previous conversation history may be restored

## Cross-Sport Blocking

Blocks apply across both sport universes:

- Block someone in Tennis → also blocked in Pickleball
- This prevents harassment across sports

## Abuse Prevention

### Reporting

1. Block Player
2. Optionally: "Report to Rallia"
3. Select reason:
   - Harassment
   - Inappropriate behavior
   - No-shows / Unreliable
   - Spam
   - Other
4. Add details (optional)
5. Submit

Reports go to admin for review. See [Admin](../15-admin/README.md).
