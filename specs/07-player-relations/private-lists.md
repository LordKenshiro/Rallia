# Private Lists

## Overview

Private lists allow users to organize contacts who are NOT on the app, enabling match invitations to non-users.

> **Growth Hack:** At app launch, when there are few users, players will be encouraged to create private lists to invite non-users to matches.

## Creating a Private List

### From Phone Contacts

1. User taps "Create Private List"
2. Prompted to access phone contacts
3. Select contacts to add
4. Name the list
5. List created

### Manual Entry

For contacts not in phone:

1. Tap "Add Contact Manually"
2. Enter:
   - Name (required)
   - Phone number and/or Email (at least one required)
3. Contact added to list

## List Management

### Actions

| Action          | Description        |
| --------------- | ------------------ |
| Rename List     | Change list name   |
| Add Contacts    | Add more people    |
| Remove Contacts | Remove individuals |
| Delete List     | Remove entire list |

### Multiple Lists

Users can create multiple private lists:

- "Tennis friends"
- "Work colleagues"
- "Family"
- etc.

## Using Private Lists

### Match Invitations

When creating a match:

1. Select "Private Match"
2. Choose recipients:
   - Individual favorites
   - Groups
   - Communities
   - **Private Lists** ← Non-app users
3. Match invitation sent via SMS/Email

### Non-User Experience

When a non-user receives an invitation:

1. SMS/Email with match details
2. Link to accept or decline
3. On acceptance:
   - Must provide name, email, phone
   - Receive calendar confirmation
   - Prompted to install app

See [Match Lifecycle](../09-matches/match-lifecycle.md) for non-user acceptance flow.

## Data Collection

Contact info from private lists feeds into:

- Mailing list for app invitations
- Growth system for user acquisition

See [Growth](../14-growth/README.md) for invitation mechanics.

## Privacy

- Private lists are only visible to the creator
- Contacts in private lists are not searchable
- When a contact joins the app, they become a regular user
  - Optionally prompt to add them to favorites
  - Remove from private list (now on app)
